    <p>
        I thoroughly enjoy writing code and building applications. I can moderately tolerate hours of debugging. Web development, Mac/iOS applications or general software are my main areas of interest. I can handle front end web development if needed and am familiar with CSS preprocessors and responsive design.
    </p>

    <p>
        I like to think that my skills as a designer, and someone who is genuinely interested in all types of design, sets me apart from other developers. Understanding how the form complements the function of an application (and vice versa) is important, and I strive to do that.
