    Along with development and design, music production has been a passion of mine for the last 15 years. Most of the music I create is electronic music where I use synthesizers and samplers to make songs. That shouldn’t suggest I’m not interested in tonal music, however. Music theory and tonality are very important to the songs I create. I play the bass guitar and drums as well.

    I’ve used Logic Pro since version 4.5 and am very familiar this widely used software. Although I prefer to use Logic, it’s only a tool which is used to mix and record. I’ve mixed and recorded hundreds of songs over the years. Thousands of hours have been spent developing and honing techniques used in audio production.

    <h1>Sound Design</h1>

    <p>
    Making electronic music lends itself to exploring the sonic possibilities of sound more than any other type of music. I’ve always been interested in creating and manipulating sound in new ways. In my music, I create every element in the song. Aside from a few 808/909 samples here and there, almost everything is created from scratch.
    </p>

    <p>
    Using advanced synthesis techniques and audio editing skills, I can put my years of experience to work creating a wide array of sounds. From morphing background textures to laser sounds and alien voices, I’m capable of creating many different sounds. I’m quite interested in working with someone in film or video game development to design sound elements for a project.
