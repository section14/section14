    Based out of Santa Barbara, CA, Vector Films needed both a logo and a simple website to showcase work. The logo went through a few iterations before deciding on this simple and bold design. One of the requirements of the logo was that it needed to be easy to animate. Also, something that could be flexible with the color scheme was also desired. Overall, the client is happy with the design.

    The website was built with HTML and CSS. The next update will feature a back-end with an easy to use video management panel. Debating on whether to use goland or node.js.
